This repository intended for hosting tools to make creating pSets for our weekly contests a less painful, more automated process.

Contest Creator Specifications:

- [ ] Should not have repeated problem from any past contest. So, each contest should be a unique one
- [ ] Should be able to sync with a database (I'm thinking of an spreadsheet over Google Sheets API) and keep the stuff in sync
- [ ] Scrape the Codeforces API with the tags and theme of the contest given and with a problem's difficulty range and sync with the spreadsheet.
- [ ] We should be able to get problems of our previous mashup contests
